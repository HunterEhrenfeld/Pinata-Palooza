## What does your app do?

_Describe in a paragraph or so_

In a celebrity-themed version of Guess Who, players try to identify a famous person based on yes-or-no questions about their appearance. The game board features various celebrities from different industries like music, film, sports, and politics. Players can ask questions such as "Does your person have bald hair?" or "Is your person sad?" to narrow down the possibilities. The objective is to guess the correct celebrity before your opponent does by strategically eliminating options based on the answers given. Itâ€™s a fun, engaging way to test knowledge of pop culture and famous figures. This project uses Pinata to store the images and to fetch them.
